# ITSE 1430 - Programming in C#

This repository is where your classwork and lab assignments will go.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin note the following prerequisites for your environment.

1.	Windows  7 SP1 or higher or Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 or higher 
2.	1.8 Ghz or faster processor (dual core or higher strongly recommended)
3.	2 GB memory (4 GB or more strongly recommended)
4.	10+ GB hard drive space
5.	Fast internet connection for downloading software
6.	Additional requirements may be found here. Note that older operating systems may require additional Windows updates to be installed.

*Note: Mac, Linux and Android are not supported operating systems. These platforms are not supported and no assistance can be given if you choose to use them. Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio for Mac currently do not support the necessary project types used by the course. You may be able to them however most of the tools discussed below will not work and no support can be given for its use. You are responsible for ensuring any labs completed using other version of Visual Studio work correctly in VS 2017 as well.*

If you are unable to meet the above requirements then you will need to use the Computer Lab available on campus.

## Repository Layout

The repository is laid out in a way to make it easier for you to work with during class.

- `classwork` is where your daily classwork will go. Each time we do work in class you will push the work to this folder so you can refer to it later.
- `labs` is where your lab assignments will go. Each lab assignment will go into its own subfolder. It is from this folder that I will grade your lab assignments.
- `.editorconfig` is a style configuration file that Visual Studio uses to help guide styling of your code.
- `.git` is a core Git folder. Never touch or modify this folder. Doing so will potentially prevent you from syncing with Github.
- `.gitattributes` is a core Git file. Do not touch or remove this file.
- `.gitignore` is a core Git file. Do not touch or remove this file.
